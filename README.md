# Ambient Sounds

Ambient Sounds is a Noctalia mixer for playing several looping ambient tracks at the same time.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `reaperhound/ambient-sounds` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `ambient-sounds`; panel: `main`; shortcut: `toggle` |

## Features

- Mix ten bundled ambient recordings simultaneously.
- Toggle each sound independently and adjust its volume.
- Apply a per-sound amplification boost.
- Start or stop the complete mix from one control.
- Read and adjust the default PipeWire output volume through `wpctl`.
- Open the mixer from a bar widget, a control-center shortcut, or panel IPC.

## Requirements

The following executables must be installed and available on `PATH`:

- `mpv` for looping audio playback.
- `socat` for sending control commands to mpv's Unix sockets.
- `wpctl` for reading and changing the default PipeWire sink volume.
- `pkill` and `rmdir` for process fallback cleanup and temporary socket-directory cleanup.

## Usage

Add the `ambient-sounds` widget from Noctalia's widget picker. Clicking it toggles the mixer panel.

Add the `toggle` shortcut from Settings → Control Center shortcuts to open the mixer from the control center.

The panel can also be opened directly:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle reaperhound/ambient-sounds:main
```

In the panel, enable individual sounds, move their volume sliders, use `Amplify` for a small extra gain boost, or use `START ENGINE` / `STOP ENGINE` for the whole mix. Enabled sounds are started when the engine starts and loop until disabled or stopped.

## Settings

This plugin declares no Noctalia settings. Sound levels and enabled state are session-local.

## IPC

The plugin does not expose custom IPC events. The `panel-toggle` command above opens its panel.

## Notes

- Playback is local. The plugin makes no network calls and does not upload audio or user data.
- Each playing sound is a separate `mpv` process with a private Unix socket under `/tmp/noctalia-ambient-<timestamp>/`.
- Disabling a sound sends mpv a quit command, uses its socket-specific `pkill` fallback, and removes the socket. Closing the panel runtime stops all players and removes the temporary socket files and directory.
- Sound files are resolved relative to the installed plugin directory, so the plugin does not depend on the author's checkout path.
- This repository currently lacks source and license records for the bundled recordings. Redistribution is BLOCKED until each file's license and attribution requirements are established. See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).
